# House-Price-Prediction-Clustering

Objective: The goal of the project is to predict house prices based on labeled data using a classification technique. This involves mapping features (independent variables) to the target (dependent variable) to predict house prices.

Classification Algorithms:
1. *Decision Tree:* 
2. *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):*

### Preventing Overfitting: 

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, resulting in poor model performance. To prevent overfitting, cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation is used. grid search is applied to tune the hyperparameters of the models.
